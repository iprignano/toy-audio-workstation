**Toy Audio Workstation** (TAW) is a simple audio sequencer that lets you play drums and keys in a loop, save the results and share them with friends.

I wanted to explore the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and try [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) on a "real" project – and ended up building this. I hope someone can find it as fun to play with as I do!
